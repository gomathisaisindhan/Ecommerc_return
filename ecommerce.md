# Ecommerc_return
E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis identifies why customers return products and how return rates vary by category, region, and marketing channel. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, the project builds a predictive model and interactive dashboard to highlight high-risk products and reduce returns.
# E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis

## Objective

Identify why customers return products and analyze how return rates vary by product category, geography, suppliers, and marketing channels. The goal is to reduce returns using data-driven insights.

## Tools Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* SQL
* Power BI
* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow

1. Cleaned and prepared order and return datasets
2. Analyzed return percentage by category, supplier, city, and channel
3. Built a logistic regression model to predict return probability
4. Identified high-risk products and exported them as CSV
5. Created an interactive Power BI dashboard with drill-through filters

 ## Note on Jupyter Notebook Rendering

Some interactive HTML outputs in the Jupyter Notebook may not render correctly on GitHub.  
To view the complete outputs and visualizations:
- Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab and rerun all cells, or
- Use nbviewer.org by pasting the GitHub notebook link.

This does not affect the correctness of the analysis or results.


## Deliverables

* Interactive Power BI dashboard
* Python codebase for analysis and prediction
* CSV file of high-risk products

## Key Outcome

The project highlights high-risk categories, suppliers, and regions, helping businesses take preventive actions to reduce product returns and improve customer satisfaction.
